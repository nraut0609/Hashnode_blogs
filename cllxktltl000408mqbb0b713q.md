## **Task-01: Setting Up CI/CD with Jenkins and GitHub Webhooks: A Comprehensive Guide**

* **Document the process** from cloning the repository to adding webhooks, Deployment, etc. as a README, go through [**this example**](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/fynd-my-movie/blob/master/README.md)
    

A well-written readme file will help others to understand your project and you will understand how to use the project again without any problems.

## Introduction

Greetings! Here is the all-inclusive manual designed to assist you in establishing a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) system through the utilization of Jenkins and GitHub Webhooks. Within this document, you will discover a detailed walkthrough that encompasses every stage, commencing from repository cloning and culminating in webhook setup and deployment configuration. By following these directives, you will establish an effortless and automated developmental workflow.

## Jenkins Configuration Process

1. Install and set up Jenkins on your server, making sure it's operational.
    
2. Open your web browser to access the Jenkins dashboard.
    
3. Establish a new Jenkins task for your project:
    
    * Select "New Item" on the dashboard.
        
    * Name your task and pick the relevant project category (e.g., Freestyle project).
        
4. Set up the source code management parameters, commonly employing Git.
    
5. Depending on your project's needs, install essential plugins to activate GitHub integration and Docker compatibility.
    

## Setting Up GitHub Webhooks

1. Within your GitHub repository, proceed to "Settings" and then select "Webhooks".
    
2. Click on "Add webhook":
    
3. Input the Payload URL, consisting of your Jenkins job's URL followed by "/github-webhook/" (e.g., [http://your-jenkins-server/job/your-job-name/github-webhook/](http://your-jenkins-server/job/your-job-name/github-webhook/)).
    
4. Set the content type as "application/json".
    
5. Pick the specific events that will activate the webhook (e.g., "Push events").
    
6. For enhanced security, you have the option to include a secret.
    
7. Safeguard the webhook configuration by saving your changes.
    

## Docker and Docker Compose Installation

1. Install Docker on your Jenkins server as per the instructions provided in the official documentation.
    
2. Follow the official installation guide to set up Docker Compose.
    

## Deployment Procedure Configure your Jenkins task:

* Within the task's configuration, specify the URL of your GitHub repository.
    

Establish build triggers that utilize the GitHub webhook you recently established.

### Arrange your deployment actions within the Jenkins task:

* Depending on your project's nature, you can employ Docker Compose, scripts, or alternative tools.
    

Ensure the task effectively builds, tests, and deploys your application.

Whenever there are code updates in your GitHub repository, the webhook will automatically trigger your Jenkins task.

### **Addressing Issues**

Should any complications arise during setup or deployment, consult the troubleshooting section within this repository or seek assistance from the community.

## Task-02: Goal Planner

* Also, it's important to keep smaller goals, as it's a small task, think of a small Goal you can accomplish.
    
* Write about it using [**this template**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shubhamlondhe1996_taking-resolutions-and-having-goals-for-an-activity-7023858409762373632-s2J8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
    
* Have small goals and strategies to achieve them, and also have a small reward for yourself.
